ORDER

Entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include schizophrenia, is granted.

FINDING OF FACT

Affording the Veteran with the benefit of the doubt, his schizophrenia began during active service.

CONCLUSION OF LAW

The criteria for entitlement to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder, to include schizophrenia, have been met. 38 U.S.C. §§ 1110, 5107(b); 38 C.F.R. §§ 3.303, 3.304, 4.125.

REASONS AND BASES FOR FINDING AND CONCLUSION

The Veteran had active service from March 1999 to July 1999. This case comes before the Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) on appeal from a September 2013 rating decision by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Regional Office (RO) in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

The Board denied the Veteran's claim for service connection for schizophrenia, among other claims, in a December 2018 decision. The Veteran appealed that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Court). The Court issued a November 2019 memorandum decision, vacating and remanding the part of the Board's decision that denied the psychiatric disability claim. Following the Court's remand, the Board remanded the matter in June 2020 for additional development including a nexus opinion that adequately addressed the date of initial onset and etiology of the Veteran's psychiatric disability. The matter returned to the Board in October 2020 at which time the scope of the claim was recharacterized under Clemons v. Shinseki, 23 Vet. App. 1, (2009) to include any acquired psychiatric disorder and the amended claim was remanded for a supplemental VA medical opinion.

This matter was most recently before the Board in February 2021 when it was remanded once again for additional development to include obtaining any updated VA treatment records for the period from December 2016 to the present, requesting the Veteran complete a VA Form 21-4142 to authorize VA to obtain any updated private treatment records, and obtaining a new medical opinion (and examination if deemed necessary). The record indicates that the RO received a completed Form 21-4142 for private treatment records and the VA requested those records in March 2021, updated VA treatment records were added to the claims file in October 2021, an October 2021 VA medical opinion was obtained, and the RO issued an October 2021 supplemental statement of the case (SSOC).

The record includes a July 2021 denial for release of requested records by the private provider based on a failure to include a release or authorization with the records request. The denial noted two additional denials in March 2021. Notwithstanding VA's attempt to obtain the private treatment records, the Veteran was informed in a June 2021 correspondence that even though VA has requested the identified information, it was his responsibility to ensure that VA receives it (except for any evidence kept by the VA, military, or any other federal government agency). The Board notes that VA's duty to assist in the development of a claim is not "a one-way street." Wood v. Derwinski, 1 Vet. App. 190, 193 (1991), aff'd on reconsideration, 1 Vet. App. 406 (1991). Rather, the Veteran has an obligation to assist in the adjudication of his claim. "If a Veteran wishes help, he cannot passively wait for it in those circumstances where he may or should have information that is essential in obtaining the putative evidence." Wood, supra. at 195. The Board finds that there was substantial compliance with the remand directives. See Stegall v. West, 11. Vet. App. 268 (1998); but see D'Aries v. Peake, 22 Vet. App. 97, 104 (2008). The matter has returned to the Board for appellate review.

The Veteran contends, to include in his October 2013 Notice of Disagreement (NOD) and his January 2017 VA Form 9, that he is entitled to service connection for an acquired psychiatric disorder to include schizophrenia and depression because
